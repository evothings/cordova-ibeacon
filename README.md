# Experimental iBeacon JavaScript library for Android

A small JavaScript library to scan for iBeacons. Uses the cordova-ble plugin. Works on Android only.

We recommend using the Cordova iBEacon plugin by Peter Metz, which works on both iOS and Android, see this repository: https://github.com/petermetz/cordova-plugin-ibeacon
